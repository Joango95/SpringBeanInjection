# Spring bean creation control demo project

This project is intended to demo how to create beans in a controled way using spring annotations and spring variables.
It uses annotations like @Configuration, @Bean, @Value and @ConditionalOnProperty in two different ways as well as environment variables from application.properties files to show how spring lets us build our application as we want, like if we where using building blocks.

More information on how this annotations and env variables work can be found on https://medium.com/@joango95/two-ways-of-using-spring-env-variables-and-annotations-to-control-bean-injection-aaf594187eda
